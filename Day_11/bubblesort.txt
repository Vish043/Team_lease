We need to sort the list in ascending order

1.Start from the first element of the list.

2.Compare each pair of adjacent elements:
If the left element is greater than the right, swap them.

3.Repeat this process for all elements — after each full pass, the largest element "bubbles" to the end.

4.Continue this process n-1 times (where n is the number of elements).

5.The list is sorted when no swaps are needed in a full pass.
