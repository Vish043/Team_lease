We need to sort the list in ascending order

1.Start from the second element (index 1), considering the first element as a sorted part.

2.Compare the current element with the elements in the sorted part (to its left).

3.Shift all the larger elements in the sorted part one position to the right.

4.Insert the current element into its correct position in the sorted part.

5.Repeat steps 2-4 for all elements in the list.

6.After all passes, the list will be sorted.
