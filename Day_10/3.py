##. At this time, the function format_greeting is printing the names only. Please update the mapping function so it creates a list where each item contains the following:
##'Hello, my name is <name> and I am <age> years old'
##ðŸ’¡ Hints:
##You have to get the age of each person based on their birth_date.

##Take your time to understand the already defined calculate_age function.

##Search in Google "How to get the age of a given birth date in python".

##Inside your format_greeting function you have to return a concatenation.

##Expected result:
##The result should be similar to this, but the ages might be different.

##[ 'Hello, my name is Joe and I am 32 years old',
  ##'Hello, my name is Bob and I am 42 years old',
  ##'Hello, my name is Erika and I am 28 years old',
  ##'Hello, my name is Dylan and I am 18 years old',
  ##'Hello, my name is Steve and I am 14 years old' ]
